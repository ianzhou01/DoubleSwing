# DoubleSwing

* Simulates behavior of a double pendulum swinging through space, with adjustable friction coefficients
* Optimizes free motion calculations with Runge-Kutta (RK4) numerical integration of Euler-Lagrange equations
* Functionality to change length and mass of pendulum mid-swing (in progress)
* Draggable interactive demo with enhanced responsiveness to real-time interaction
