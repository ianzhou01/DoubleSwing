# DoubleSwing

* Simulates behavior of a double pendulum swinging through space, with adjustable friction coefficients
* Motion is calculated with Runge-Kutta (RK4) numerical integration of Euler-Lagrange equations for optimized accuracy
* Functionality to change length and mass of pendulum mid-swing (in progress)
* Draggable interactive demo with enhanced responsiveness to dragging physics
